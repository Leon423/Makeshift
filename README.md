# Makeshift
Multiplayer FPS game built in Unreal Engine 4. Heavily inspired by the halo series.

This project cannot be run with just the source from github. It also requires binaries, art, etc that is stored in a private dropbox.
The code in this project uses ShooterGame as a base and is not intended to be used for any commercial reasons.
This code was created as a learning experience and is in no way production ready.
