# Makeshift
Multiplayer FPS game built in Unreal Engine 4. Heavily inspired by the halo series.

This project cannot be run with just the source from github. It also requires binaries, art, etc. which can be obtained from the google drive link below. All content is not to be used commercially.
The code in this project uses ShooterGame as a base and is not intended to be used for any commercial reasons.
This code was created as a learning experience and is in no way production ready.

This .zip contains all of the code in this repo, as well as the rest of the content needed to launch the game. The only other thing needed is an Unreal Engine 4.6 installation.
